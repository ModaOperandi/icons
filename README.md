## What is this?

This is a build pipeline for dealing with and packaging SVG icons into React components. It optimizes SVGs using SVGO, then publishes a package `@moda/icons` which exports each individual icon as a component. **By copying the import out of the [click-to-copy](https://moda-om-icons.netlify.app/) documentation you ensure you import only the icons you need.**

## Meta

- **State**: production
- **Point people**: @ModaOperandi/ecommerce-squad

## Getting started

```bash
npm install --save @moda/icons
```

Visit: [https://moda-om-icons.netlify.app/](https://moda-om-icons.netlify.app/) and click the desired icon to copy its `import` statement.

```tsx
import ShoppingBagIcon from "@moda/icons/shopping-bag-24";

// Use it as a normal React component

const Foo = () => (
  <>
    Checkout whats in my <ShoppingBagIcon />
  </>
);
```

By default all icons are sized according to their native dimensions. So the example above: `shopping-bag-24`, would be 24Ã—24px by default. This can be overridden by passing in width and height props:

```tsx
<ShoppingBagIcon width="2em" height="2em" />
```

Color is set using the `currentcolor` prop so icons are the same color as their parent div. This provides a simple way to change the fill color.

```scss
.ParentContainer {
  color: black;
  &:hover {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

Alternatively this can be set using a prop:

```tsx
<ShoppingBagIcon color="#f00" />
```

## Adding an icon

The SVG you wish to add *must be outlined*.

Once you have an SVG you want to add, simply import it to [`src/svg`](/src/svg) using the naming convention of snake-cased name followed by the desired native size: `Arrow_Down_12.svg`.
